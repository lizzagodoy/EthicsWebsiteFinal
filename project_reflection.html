            <h3>Advice for future students who work on this project...</h3>
            <p>While we were able to accomplish several goals for this website, we believe that there are still some ways in which it can be further improved. 
                We recommend that the next thing to work on is how to make the website more aesthetically pleasing and fun to use. 
                We feel like Google Forms, though easy to create and use, looks outdated and is not as fun as other storytelling games. 
                For this aspect, we highly encourage looking into the platform Twine and thinking about how the HTML can be incorporated into the website.
            </p>
            <p>Next, we recommend rearranging the website so that it is symmetrical and more aesthetically pleasing to look at, perhaps playing around with the 
                font sizing or card sizes. Last, we felt like hosting the scenario workshops were extremely rewarding, so we recommend continuing this and inviting 
                more people who may not have a background in computer science to come as well.
