            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>The Ethics tool is designed to present ethical scenarios for education use, such as in classrooms or for research. 
                Previous teams have created a website from the ground up that is functional and includes several scenarios to 
                explore. The previous team organized the Google Drive that holds all the scenarios in Google Forms formatting 
                and built a website with searchable “cards” to play the scenarios. However, the links are now broken, as access 
                has been changed from year to year. Our role in this project is to fix those broken links, work on some website 
                aesthetics and expand on more scenarios for students to explore and learn from.

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>1. Transfer all scenarios to a permanent folder that will be able to be accessed when students working on the project lose their emails upon graduation.</p>
            <p>2. Evaluate all old scenarios: check for link access to form, images, and overview graphs. Evaluate the grammatical and comprehension errors in scenarios and fox as needed.</p>
            <p>3. Fix website’s HTML to have correct link access to all forms, images and overview graphs.</p>
            <p>4. Test and review external storytelling tools and decide whether new game tool will be incorporated </p>    
            <p>5. Host two scenario workshops with students in class. Focus on topics related to Artificial Intelligence.</p>
            <p>6. Evaluate new scenarios and add to website html.</p>    
            <p>7. Keep close track of all forms, overview graphs, and images on the excel tracker sheet. That way, links related to every specific scenario</p>
