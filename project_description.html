            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>The Ethics tool is designed to present ethical scenarios for education use, such as in classrooms or for research. 
                Previous teams have created a website from the ground up that is functional and includes several scenarios to 
                explore. The previous team organized the Google Drive that holds all the scenarios in Google Forms formatting 
                and built a website with searchable “cards” to play the scenarios. However, the links are now broken, as access 
                has been changed from year to year. Our role in this project is to fix those broken links, work on some website 
                aesthetics and expand on more scenarios for students to explore and learn from.
